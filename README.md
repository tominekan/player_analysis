# NBA Player Analysis 

This script aims to analyze NBA player data for the 2024-2025 NBA season in order to come up with an algorithm that ranks each player based on their statistics. In addition, you can come up with an imaginary player with specific statistics (such as a player from another era) and see how they would rank in the 2024-2025 season.

### Notes:
- I'd prefer to have game by game-by-game data instead of averages but it do what it do. 
- Some more extensions to the idea would be to compile all modern NBA season data and come up with all time rankings.
    - This is a tough thing to do because it might be hard to find a ranking of all NBA Players post-1996
    - It might also be tough to deal with averaging out player data over multiple seasons
